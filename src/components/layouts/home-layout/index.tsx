                San Diego is an amazing place to live, work, and visit. But like
                many cities, San Diego faces a number of difficult challenges
                around mobility, climate, housing, and public health. Design for
                San Diego (D4SD) is an initiative to address complex challenges
                through design thinking and crowdsourcing.

              D4SD seeks to connect young, passionate designers to a network of
              industry professionals and structure a process for collectively
              addressing civic challenges related to the sustainability of our
              region. We are exploring new models for collective innovation
              where the community works together to discover problems, explore
              solutions, and build prototypes to test ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              D4SD 2020 will host a series of design events including speakers,
              studios, and design-athons, starting in January. This will
              culminate into a summit in April where innovators can pitch their
              proposed solutions, and build alliances to make change happen.

                  As people are looking for alternate ways to move around, while
                  also wanting to reduce their emissions, the topic of inclusive
                  and environmentally conscious transportation continues to be a
                  pressing issue in our urban environment. Mobility can be
                  examined from a number of lenses such as motor vehicle
                  systems, transit, parking, intermodal connections, electric
                  vehicles, accident reduction, walkability and bike-ability,
                  and land-use patterns.

                  Burning of fossil fuels has resulted in the gradual increase
                  of global temperatures. Scientists have high confidence that
                  global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come.
                  Climate change impacts areas such as transportation, housing,
                  health, natural resources, food waste, agriculture, air
                  pollution, and education.

                  Shelter is a fundamental human need; however people have
                  limited choices for safe, affordable, and long-term housing in
                  San Diego. The issue of housing is more than the physical
                  structures. It also includes homelessness, land development,
                  smart home technology, and mixed-use housing, all of which
                  needs to be addressed with San Diegoâ€™s growing population.

                  Many San Diego residents have limited access to preventative
                  and restorative health services. Health is determined by
                  social and physical environments and is directly connected to
                  how people live, learn, work, and play. Topics such as quality
                  of life, population health, and social well being, are all
                  different aspects of how we as a city, need to improve our
                  well being.
