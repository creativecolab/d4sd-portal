        "To enter the D4SD 2020 Challenge, teams must submit the final submission deliverables by May 1, 2020 at 11:59PM PDT.<br /><br />In general, solutions to the D4SD Challenge will be assessed based on <b>five key criteria</b>:<ol><li><b>Human-centered process</b><ul><li>How effectively does the team involve stakeholders, obtain feedback, and leverage data to support design decisions?</li><li>To what extent does the team discover the core problems at the heart of a civic challenge?</li></ul></li><li><b>Improving on the current status quo</b><ul><li>Does the team effectively map out a competitive analysis of existing solutions, technologies, work-arounds etc. both within San Diego and beyond?</li><li>Does this proposal expand on what San Diego already has?</li><li>How unique is the solution compared to other available solutions?</li></ul><li><b>Feasibility/viability/harmony</b><ul><li>How likely is it that this proposal could get implemented?</li><li>Has the team considered what it would need to lead this project through the next stages of development (e.g., rough budget, development plan)?</li></ul></li><li><b>Impact/desirability:</b><ul><li>How will the solution affect people?</li><li>Does it have any downsides?</li></ul></li><li><b>Communication quality:</b><ul><li>Does the poster follow good visual design principles?</li><li>Does the team have a good verbal pitch of their problem and proposed solution?</li><li>Does the optional video tell a compelling story?</li></ul></li></ol><br />The judging process has two rounds:<ol><li>In round one, a panel of experts in human-centered design, civics, and business will assess the deliverables according to the criteria listed above. This judging process will happen between May 1 and May 10.  Finalists will be notified on May 10th through email so they can prepare a slide and verbal pitch for the Summit.</li><li>In round two, distinguished jurors will assess the finalists during the online D4SD Summit on May 12th. Teams must have at least one team member available to present the poster throughout the day and to interact with jurors. Finalist teams will deliver a two-minute verbal pitch during the D4SD Awards Ceremony on May 12th.</li></ol>"
    },
    {
      question: "What kinds of design work can we submit to the challenge?",
      answer:
        "Submissions can be proposals for new products, software, services, infrastructure changes, or policies for any topic related to making San Diego a more sustainable city. Since D4SD is oriented towards making real change in the world, teams should consider the possible paths for getting ideas adopted or moved into the next stage of development. In practical terms, how will this idea get funding or resources to move it forward?  To support a wide range of possible proposals, D4SD will accept one of three types of submissions:<ol><li><b>Entrepreneurial</b>: Projects in this category will be oriented as very early-stage startups that would need investments from the business community to get off the ground. Entrepreneurial projects will typically be concepts for new products or services and would include a rough business plan.</li><li><b>Civic</b>: These projects would be oriented towards leaders of large organizations that provide funds/resources projects for the public good. This could be targeted at the <a href='https://data.sandiego.gov/' target='_blank'> City of San Diego </a> or at an established organization (i.e., your school) that could help to vet and test the proposed concepts. Civic projects will typically be concepts for new policies or changes to civic infrastructure (e.g., parks, roads, structures).</li><li><b>Philanthropic</b>: These projects would rely on support and resources from the public or donors. Some concepts could really improve how people live, but will have a hard time getting funded as a business or as a civic project. For these proposals, the team should consider creating a crowdfunding campaign to take the concepts directly to the public.  Philanthropic projects will typically be concepts for new experiences for residents or new social/cultural campaigns.</li></ol>D4SD compiled a list of videos, articles, toolkits, and other resources that can be useful for people working through the design challenges (check those out on the <a href='/resources'>Resource page</a>)."
