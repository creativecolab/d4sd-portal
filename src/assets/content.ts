Our aim is to provide a space for our community to discover key civic issues, to ideate and prototype solutions to the problems they see, to pitch their proposals in a public forum, and to activate others to help bring them to life.<br/><br/>This year’s theme— How can we make San Diego a more sustainable city— is rooted in the United Nations’ 2030 vision to transform our world by making cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. D4SD has organized the challenges around four main topics, but you are welcome to explore anything related to sustainability:<li><b>HEALTH</b>: How might we help all San Diegans live healthy and active lives?</li><li><b>MOBILITY</b>: How might we help people move freely in San Diego?</li><li><b>ENVIRONMENT</b>: How might we prepare San Diego for natural and human-influenced environmental challenges?</li><li><b>HOUSING</b>: How might we reimagine housing to meet the needs of all San Diegans?</li>"

    },
    {
      question: "What kinds of design work can we submit to the challenge?",
      answer:
        "Submissions can be proposals for new products, software, services, infrastructure changes, or policies for any topic related to making San Diego a more sustainable city. Since D4SD is oriented towards making real change in the world, teams should consider the possible paths for getting ideas adopted or moved into the next stage of development. In practical terms, how will this idea get funding or resources to move it forward?  To support a wide range of possible proposals, D4SD will accept one of three types of submissions:<ol><li><b>Entrepreneurial</b>: Projects in this category will be oriented as very early-stage startups that would need investments from the business community to get off the ground. Entrepreneurial projects will typically be concepts for new products or services and would include a rough business plan.</li><li><b>Civic</b>: These projects would be oriented towards leaders of large organizations that provide funds/resources projects for the public good. This could be targeted at the <a href='https://data.sandiego.gov/' target='_blank'> City of San Diego </a> or at an established organization (i.e., your school) that could help to vet and test the proposed concepts. Civic projects will typically be concepts for new policies or changes to civic infrastructure (e.g., parks, roads, structures).</li><li><b>Philanthropic</b>: These projects would rely on support and resources from the public or donors. Some concepts could really improve how people live, but will have a hard time getting funded as a business or as a civic project. For these proposals, the team should consider creating a crowdfunding campaign to take the concepts directly to the public.  Philanthropic projects will typically be concepts for new experiences for residents or new social/cultural campaigns.</li></ol>D4SD compiled a list of videos, articles, toolkits, and other resources that can be useful for people working through the design challenges (check those out on the <a href='/resources'>Resource page</a>)."

After thinking about your own personal network, think about the challenge itself, e.g., does it occur more often in some regions of San Diego than others, what groups of people might be affected by or related to the challenge, who are the people or institutions that might already be working to address the challenge?  This line of inquiry can help to identify the stakeholders involved with a civic challenge. <br/><br/> When initially connecting with a stakeholder, aim for the first meeting to operate less like an interview and more like a meet-and-greet.  When reaching out to a stakeholder, come with general questions about their day-to-day, rather than targeted questions based on your hunches about the design challenge space. <i>(e.g., What kind of role do you play related to [design challenge arena]? In what ways do you currently work to address [design challenge arena]? What is going well? What is not going so well? Where do you anticipate this going in the future (near term, long term)?)</i>"
