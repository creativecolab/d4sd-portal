faqs: [
  {
    question: 'What is D4SD?',
    answer: 'Design for San Diego (D4SD) is a civic design initiative that brings together innovators, mentors, experts, and citizens to address San Diego’s most challenging issues through human-centered design. Our aim is to provide a space that allows for the community to discover key civic issues, to ideate and prototype solutions to the problems they see, to pitch their proposals in a public forum, and to activate others to help bring them to life.<br/><br/>This year’s theme— How can we make San Diego a more sustainable city— is rooted in the United Nations’ 2030 vision to transform our world by making cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. D4SD has organized the challenges around four main topics, but you are welcome to explore anything related to sustainability:<li>Housing</li><li>Mobility</li> <li>Health</li> <li>Climate</li>',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why should I participate in D4SD?',
    answer: "Join D4SD for this unique opportunity to collaborate and compete with other city innovators to help address sustainability-related issues facing San Diego and cities around the world. The best proposals will be rewarded with financial and mentoring resources to further develop their ideas into reality. <br/><br/>Participants may benefit from:<li> Solving real problems and inspiring change in your community.</li><li> Learning human-centered design practices from professional designers and educators in the UC San Diego Design Lab. </li><li> Working with real data and collaborate with the City of San Diego's data portal and award-winning Performance and Analytics Department. </li><li>Making new connections through networking opportunities with designers, engineers, data scientists, civic leaders, entrepreneurs, and other innovators. </li><li>Earning resources and building alliances to help develop your team’s proposal into a startup business, an infrastructure development, or a policy proposal.</li>",
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I get started?',
    answer: "Our goal is to motivate and support citizens in learning how to use human-centered design to truly understand issues facing our region and to creatively generate solutions that could improve sustainability in San Diego. There’s many ways to get started:<li>You can learn more about the D4SD sustainability topics on the <a href='/challenges'>Challenges page</a>. </li><li>You can also <a href='http://eepurl.com/c2kFon' target='_blank'>sign up to be on our mailing list</a> and to volunteer for other roles as part of the challenge. </li><li>You can chat online with other innovators, experts, and citizens through our <a href='https://join.slack.com/t/d4sd/shared_invite/enQtMjExMjA5MDY0MjkzLTk3NjY4NGM3MTE0N2M1NTJjODAxMGRiMDgxNmQ4ZDk1NTU4Mzk0OThjMTdkMzc0NTJmY2M1ZmNkZDA3NTdjYTU' target='_blank'>D4SD Slack forum</a>. </li><li>You can attend one of the in-person events to help you connect with other innovators and to get mentorship from design practitioners.</li><li>You can read up on human-centered design, get advice on building stakeholder relationships, and see example solutions on the <a href='/resources'>Resources page</a>.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I form teams? ',
    answer: "While you do not need a team to enter the D4SD challenge, a team can help you build your good idea into a great solution. An effective team is one that has a mix of diverse talents all striving towards a common goal. <br/><br/>The best way to find team members is to attend one of the public D4SD events (announcements coming soon). The events will give you a chance to participate in fun hands-on activities, such as small group discussions, brainstorming, and prototyping, and will help you find people interested in similar problems. <br/><br/>If you cannot attend the in-person events, you can take advantage of the D4SD Slack Channel to look for teammates and discuss solutions with other challenge participants. You are free to communicate directly with other participants and form teams on your own. There is no limit to team size, however we recommend team sizes of 4-6.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I work on multiple teams?',
    answer: 'No. Participants can enter the challenge either as an individual or as a team. Participants can even switch teams during the challenge or combine two teams together. However, each participant can only be part of one team proposal.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Who owns the solutions?',
    answer: 'Individuals or teams will retain all intellectual property rights on solutions submitted to the D4SD Challenge. As an initiative from the UC San Diego Design Lab, D4SD is a non-profit dedicated to demonstrating the value of human-centered design and incubating great ideas into companies or longer-term projects that foster economic activity in the City of San Diego and beyond.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can my team get help on our project?',
    answer: 'D4SD supports many ways for you and your team to get help. Your team can reach out through the Slack channel, for example, by posting a message to one of the problem thread channels. Later, during the prototyping phase of D4SD, we will open a feedback exchange where you can get input from the community. D4SD also has a resources page with various tips on how to get started.',
  },
  // {
  //   question: 'How and when do I register for the challenge?',
  //   answer: "Participants can register here for the challenge between Jan 6th and March 15th 2020. Once you create a D4SD account, visit the Workspace to participate in key activities, such as discussing the challenges in the online forum, finding a team, developing a proposal, and requesting feedback from the community.",
  // },
  // {
  //   question: 'What do I need to submit throughout the challenge?',
  //   answer: "There are two deadlines for submissions: The 1st deadline is for preliminary submission which is OPTIONAL, and the 2nd deadline is for final submission which is REQUIRED. After the first deadline, there will be a feedback session during which the domain experts and community members review your submitted work and give you feedback and suggestions. After the final deadline, the deliverables will be given to our jurors to determine the winners of the challenge. So your progress on the preliminary feedback session does not play into the final judging process and it only serves for a resource for all teams to improve on their work. This is the specific requirements for these two rounds of submissions: <br/><br/><ol><li><b>Preliminary Submission</b></li><br/>The preliminary submission is valuable for you to keep track of your progress and to reflect on your work. More importantly, submitting the works by this early deadline allows you to receive feedback from the community partners of D4SD. It is up to you whether you would like to be part of this feedback session or not and your final submission will be judged on a fair basis regardless of whether you decide to enter this session or not. In other words, you can skip this deadline, submit the final submission only and still get a chance to win the challenge. However, we highly recommend that you could participate in this stage because it is the only time that you are able to get help from D4SD in terms of connecting with the specialists in the field and with the community members who are potentially affected by the problems that you defined. Their feedback might provide guidance on the iteration of your solution or even the scoping of your project overall.<br/><ol><li><b>Problem description</b></li><ol><li>Define your problem in no more than two sentences. The problem definition should be a product of your own analysis of the problem space, not simply a replication of the questions provided by D4SD. Your problem definition can be possibly grounded in user research, interviews and statistics. You can only submit one problem definition, but you can keep editing it before the deadline.</li></ol><li><b>Solutions</b></li><ol><li>You can propose at most 3 solutions for the problem you defined. Each solution should be presented as a Solution Proposal, which is suggested to include: a clear description of your solution, it could be either a concept, an illustration, a prototype of your ideas or anything that you think best represent your proposed solution. Keep in mind that at this point, the brainstorming process is more meaningful than a well constructed final product. You can upload at most 3 pdf files, each of which includes a different solution.</li></ol></ol><br/><br/><li><b>Final Submission</b></li><br/>All teams are required to submit presentation slides and a poster but only the finalists are able to give their final pitches at the summit while all teams have a chance to present their posters at the summit. These are the specific requirements for the two items in your submission:<ol><li><b>Presentation slides</b></li> <ol><li>A clear definition</li><li>An image that clearly illustrates your solution/concept </li><li> An analysis of the strengths and limitations of your solution </li></ol><li><b>Poster</b></li><ol><li>You can propose multiple solutions for the problem you choose (3 maximum), At this point, the brainstorming process is more meaningful a well constructed final product.</li><li> Each solution should include a Solution Proposal which is suggested to include: a clear description of your solution, it could be either a concept, an illustration, a prototype of your ideas or anything that you think best represent your proposed solution.</li></ol></ol>",
  // },
  // {
  //   question: 'How will my work be judged?',
  //   answer: "To enter the D4SD Challenge, teams must submit the final submission deliverables by March 15th at 11:59PM PDT.<br/><br/>In general, solutions to the D4SD Challenge will be assessed based on four key criteria: <br/><ol><li><b>Human-centered process</b> (How effectively does the team involve stakeholders, obtain feedback, and leverage data to support design decisions?)</li><li><b>Novelty</b> (How unique is the solution compared to other available solutions?)</li><li> <b>Feasibility</b> (How likely can this solution be implemented? Will it work in the real world?)</li><li><b>Impact</b> (How will the solution affect people? Does it have any downsides?) </li></ol><br/>Each deliverable will also be part of the overall judgement process: <ul><li> Problem statement:</li><ul><li>Identities and clearly articulates a real-world problem.</li><li> Provides evidence of problem (statistics pulled from cited sources, interview quotes with affected parties, etc.). </li><li> Explains how solving the problem will affect people </li></ul><li>Solution statement:</li><ul><li> Explains concept clearly and concisely.</li><li>Describes how the solution is novel/creative.</li><li> Indicates how the solution would be practical and feasible to implement. </li><li> Predicts the potential impact on both primary and secondary stakeholders.</li></ul><li>Prototype: </li><ul><li> Provides a simple demonstration of the proposed solution. </li><li> Explains clearly how the solution works.</li><li> Documents the overall process of creating the prototype and shows the iterative effort put into creating a minimal viable prototype.</li></ul><li> Poster (40” tall by 30” wide in full color):</li><ul><li>Offers a visually appealing representation of the problem and proposed solution.</li><li> Follows effective visual design principles </li><li> Represents the brand identity of the team. </li><li> Uses the designated Poster Template</li></ul></ul> <br/>The judging process has two rounds:<br/><ol><li>In round one, a panel of experts in human-centered design, civics, and business will assess the deliverables according to the criteria listed above. This judging process will happen online after the Oct 22 11:59pm PDT deadline.  Finalists will be announced on October 25th at the Design Forward community mixer at Broadway Pier (6-9pm), on the D4SD website, as well as  through email.</li><li>In round two, distinguished jurors will assess the finalists during the Design Forward Summit on Oct 26th. Teams must have at least one team member present throughout the day (7:30am-7pm) to interact with the jurors.  Finalist teams will also deliver a two-minute verbal pitch that evening during the D4SD Awards Ceremony.</li></ol>",
  // },
  // {
  //   question: 'How can I get help on my project?',
  //   answer: 'There are many ways for you and your team to get help, and D4SD supports many support options. One way your team can reach out is through the slack channel. You can propose ideas in the discussions or even ask one of the experts personally. During the D4SD challenge, there will be feedback exchange phase, where D4SD also has a resources page with various tips on how to get started.',
  // },
  // {
  //   question: 'What are the rules and resources for teams?',
  //   answer: "You do not need to work as part of a team. Individuals can create submissions on their own. If you do have a team, it can have at most five team members. <br/><br/>Each team can request a private Slack channel on the D4SD Slack Team discussion forum by filling out this form  with the team name, as well as the names and email addresses for each team member. <br/><br/>To officially enter the challenge, each individual or team must create an entry on the D4SD website by October 10.",
  // },
  // {
  //   question: 'Do I need to print my team’s poster?',
  //   answer: 'No. D4SD will cover the cost of printing posters for all valid submissions under the following conditions:<li> The entry must be complete and valid as determined by the D4SD organizing team. </li><li> The poster must follow the guidelines and use the poster template specified here. </li><li> At least one team member must be able to present your poster at the Design Forward Community Mixer on Oct 25 from 6-9pm. </li><li> If your team is selected as a finalist, at least one team member must be available for the Design Forward Summit on Oct 26th from 7:30am-7pm.</li>',
